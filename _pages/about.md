I believe there is great potential in using technology to create a sustainable future. As a data scientist, I am on a journey to apply machine learning to unlock insights from remote sensing and geospatial data, focusing on climate and environmental monitoring.

With a background in mechanical engineering, I bring a systems-thinking approach to solving complex problems. Merging this with geospatial data science, I aim to deliver actionable insights that drive global change toward a more sustainable world.
